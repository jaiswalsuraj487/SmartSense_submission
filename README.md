# Goal
1. Problem Statement:
‚óè Train a model for predicting which food establishments are at most risk for the types of
violations most likely to spread food-borne illness.

Steps:
1. I found InspectionData-scraped folder relevent from given data files and used yelp_data.csv and mapping.csv from InspectionData-scraped folder to interpret the problem statement.
2. Merged `yelp_data.csv` and `mapping.csv` on `permitid`
3. Selected permit_id	rating	crit_viol	crit_viol_cos	crit_viol_rpt	crit_viol_tbr features for my task
4. As the data is not labled i used k-means clustering algorithm
5. I found the optimal k using the elbow method and selected k= 4
6. Saw spread across various pairs of featureaand Based on that selected ('crit_viol', 'crit_viol_cos') to make decision for selection of cluster which show high crit_viol and crit_viol_cos to find which food establishments are at most risk
7. Took the indexes and returned the permit id to identify them.

I have implemented in both .py file and .ipynb file. `subimission.ipynb` file is more visually appealing. Please consider both incase of any error while executing.

Good for pulling in static historical data; would need more work to automate daily pulls

*Wunderground*

Historical data for previous 3 days can be pulled automatically and dynamically via R (investigate if python is an option)
 
Instructions for R can be found here: http://allthingsr.blogspot.com/2012/04/getting-historical-weather-data-in-r.html

data pull pending
